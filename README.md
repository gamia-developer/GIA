### Contract Code

The contract folder contains the Solidity code for the $GIA token. Our code is fully open-source, promoting transparency and security.

### Audit Reports

Safety and security are our top priorities. The audit folder includes comprehensive audit reports from leading security firms. We recommend reviewing these reports to understand the security measures in place for the $GIA token.

### ABI

The ABI folder contains the Application Binary Interface files for interacting with the $GIA contract. These files are essential for developers looking to integrate $GIA into their applications or services.

### Whitepaper

Dive deep into the vision and mechanics of the Gamia platform by reading our whitepaper. It covers everything from the inception of the idea to the detailed tokenomics and roadmap planned for Gamia.
